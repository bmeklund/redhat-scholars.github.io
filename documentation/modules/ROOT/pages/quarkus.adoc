[#one]
== Quarkus I

[cols="1,3,2"]  
|===
| *Duration* | *Audience* | *Level*
|1 hour
|Spring, Java EE, and Enterprise Java developers
|Beginner

Is your Java app consuming the server’s whole memory and taking minutes to boot? And then, even more time to redeploy? Get rid of your 25-year-old Java jokes and learn Quarkus, the supersonic, subatomic Java.
Join this deep dive session to learn how Java apps can have small memory footprints, boot in milliseconds, and help you have instantaneous save/refresh coding sessions. Interact with our CodeCasters and other attendees while learning the superpowers that Quarkus brings to next-generation apps. The world has changed, and Java changed with Quarkus, too. Upgrade your skills with us! +

You have already learned to be superfast and supersmall with Quarkus: Subatomic, Subatomic Java and added some cloud-native Kubernetes capabilities; what’s next? Adding event-driven and reactive programming.
Join this deep dive session to learn why it's crucial to adopt reactive programming, which benefits you obtain by using it, and how easy is to get started with Quarkus. You'll learn when you can get the benefits of reactive programming and how to use Quarkus to build an event-driven application. Upgrade your skills with us!

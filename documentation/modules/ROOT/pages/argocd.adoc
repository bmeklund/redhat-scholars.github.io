Having Git repositories as a single source of truth allows development teams to store the entire state of the cluster configuration in Git so that the trail of changes are visible and auditable. Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state. It automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit. +

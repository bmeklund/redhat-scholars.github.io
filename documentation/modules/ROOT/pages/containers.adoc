Imagine you're developing an application. You do your work on a laptop and your environment has a specific configuration. Other developers may have slightly different configurations. The application youâ€™re developing relies on that configuration and is dependent on specific libraries, dependencies, and files. Meanwhile, your business has development and production environments that are standardized with their own configurations and their own sets of supporting files. You want to emulate those environments as much as possible locally, but without all the overhead of recreating the server environments. So, how do you make your app work across these environments, pass quality assurance, and get your app deployed without massive headaches, rewriting, and break-fixing? The answer: containers. +

When you're developing an application, there are different tools that you can use to manage your containers. In this session, we will take a deeper dive into the world of containers, focusing on Podman Desktop, Buildah, Skopeo, and Jib.
With Podman Desktop and Buildah, you'll learn how to build, manage and run containers in a daemonless setup. Skopeo will show you how to inspect, sign, sync, and manage container images efficiently, while Jib can build optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon. +
